#summary Setting some coding style rules

= Introduction =

Due to the fact that we will be writing a Linux kernel module that creates a filesystem over USB, I strongly feel the need to use a common coding style, which has been tested and agreed upon by most programmers worldwide.

There is no time to experiment with it, so we will get accustomed to these conventions by working on the project.


= Coding Style =
Best choice of the moment is Linux kernel coding style, found at http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle.

There are a few small changes to it which I would like to experiment with:
 # avoid using any macros apart from constants: macros tend to complicate the readability of the code.
 # this coding style suggests 8 whitespace tabs, while others suggest using whitespace instead of tabbing. From my experience, 8 whitespace make it hell to read code in a virtual machine window. I propose to try for 4 whitespaces tabs. Need to work on this as we code.
