The project is licensed under MIT license (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

If you want to download a read only svn repository copy, you must have Subversion installed and run
	svn checkout http://project-soa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ [path to save repo in]

If you are a contributor to the project, you must first checkout a modifiable version of the repository,
by using
	svn checkout https://project-soa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ --username <your googlecode username> [path]

and you will be asked for your password. The readonly version uses HTTP, while the modifiable uses HTTPS. This
is important to note, as Subversion will not allow commits of modifications of the read only version of repository.

The project comes with full documentation, including articles and prior documents: /trunk/docs
Each module of the project can be found in its own /trunk/src directory, and has a Makefile that handles build process.

To build the project, you will need to have the Linux kernel 2.6.27.6 sources and the build-essential package:
	cd /usr/src  (it's recommended to have the sources in here)
	wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.27.6.tar.gz
	tar xzvf linux-2.6.27.6.tar.gz

	apt-get install build-essential

build-essential package should install the gcc, make and additional libraries, like libc, to allow kernel source compilation.
If you want to compile the kernel and make a configuration for it with menuconfig, you will also need ncurses dev lib.
	apt-get install libncurses5-dev

You can access a wiki of the project at http://code.google.com/p/project-soa/wiki/AshFS or by using the links in
the project's page. We are trying to keep it updated with the new design information.

For questions, we can be contacted on our emails.
