The project is licensed under MIT license (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

If you want to download a read only svn repository copy, you must have Subversion installed and run
	svn checkout http://project-soa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ [path to save repo in]

If you are a contributor to the project, you must first checkout a modifiable version of the repository,
by using
	svn checkout https://project-soa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ --username <your googlecode username> [path]

and you will be asked for your password. The readonly version uses HTTP, while the modifiable uses HTTPS. This
is important to note, as Subversion will not allow commits of modifications of the read only version of repository.

The project comes with full documentation, including articles and prior documents: /trunk/docs
Each module of the project can be found in its own /trunk/src directory, and has a Makefile that handles build process.

You can access a wiki of the project at http://code.google.com/p/project-soa/wiki/AshFS or by using the links in
the project's page. We are trying to keep it updated with the new design information.

For questions, we can be contacted on our emails.
