# Useful Links #

We have been extensively reading every piece of material we could find about the kernel and writing drivers because there is little to no information regarding how to write a REAL file system that uses a device. Therefore, even though old, some of these links proved really helpful in providing us with an idea of what we should be searching for in the big thing that is the kernel source.

  1. **Linux Kernel 2.6.27.6 Reference** http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.27.6/
  1. **Linux Device Drivers 3rd ed.** http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/
  1. **Linux Kernel Development, Sam's, 2nd ed**
  1. **Understanding The Linux Kernel, O'Reilly, 2nd ed** (there's also a 3rd edition for 2.6 kernels)

From the kernel sources, probably the most useful link were the filesystem ones:
  1. **FAT** http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.27.6/fs/fat/
  1. **minix** http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.27.6/fs/minix/
  1. **jffs2** http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.27.6/fs/jffs2/

Cool projects that gave us some insight on USB programming:
  1. **Writing a Linux kernel driver for an unknown USB device** http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/index.html
  1. **Writing a simple USB device driver** http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7353

We also had a look over some of our lab courses from university on Programming Operating Systems, which also proved helpful to remember things:
